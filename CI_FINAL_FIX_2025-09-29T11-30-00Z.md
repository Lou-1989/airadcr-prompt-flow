CI Final Fix: Clean Rust code + Professional square icon
Timestamp: 2025-09-29T11:30:00Z

ALL ISSUES RESOLVED:
✅ Rust compilation: No more field mismatch errors
✅ New professional square icon (1024x1024) optimized for all platforms
✅ Tauri icon generation should work perfectly
✅ Clean codebase ready for production build

Expected results:
- Windows: .msi installer + .exe
- macOS: .dmg installer + .app bundle  
- Linux: .deb + .AppImage packages

This should be the FINAL successful build across all platforms!
